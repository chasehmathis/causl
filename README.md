Methods for Specifying, Simulating from, and Fitting Marginal Causal Models


## Basic Idea

This package enables one to simulate from a *frugal parameterization*,
that is one where we have a specific marginal causal quantity of
interest and use something like a copula to model its dependence
structure. More details can be found in Evans and Didelez (2024).

### Example: Marginal structural model

``` mermaid
graph TD
    A(Z) --> B(X)
    B --> C(Y)
    A --> C
```

Suppose we have the causal model above, and are interested in a
*marginal structural model* (MSM):
$P(y \mid do(x)) = \sum_z P(z) \cdot P(y \mid z, x).$ A frugal
parameterization for this quantity would be a parametric model for
$P(y \mid do(x))$, another for $P(z,x)$, and a third for the dependence
between $Y$ and $Z$ conditional on $X$. We could use a (conditional)
copula for this last model, or a conditional odds ratio if $Y$ and $Z$
are both discrete.


One example would consist of setting
$Z \sim \text{Exp}(1)$, with $X \mid Z=z \sim N(z/2, 1)$
and $Y \mid do(X=x) \sim N((x-1)/2, 1)$,
with a Gaussian copula between $Z$ and $Y$ with correlation $\rho = 2\text{expit}(1) - 1$. 
(Note that, by default, we use the log link for the Gamma distribution.)


## Sample Code

We can specify such a marginal causal model with the following syntax.

```         
# formulae corresponding to covariates, treatments, outcomes and the dependence
forms <- list(Z ~ 1, X ~ Z, Y ~ X, ~ 1)
# vector of model families (3=gamma/exponential, 1=normal/Gaussian)
fam <- c(3, 1, 1, 1)
# list of parameters, including 'beta' (regression params) and 'phi' dispersion
pars <- list(Z = list(beta=log(1), phi=1),   # note log-link
             X = list(beta=c(0,0.5), phi=1),
             Y = list(beta=c(-0.5,0.5), phi=1),
             cop = list(beta=1))

## now create a `causl_model` object
cm <- causl_model(formulas=forms, family=fam, pars=pars)

# now simulate 100 observations
rfrugal(n=100, causl_model=cm)
```

Note that, by default, we use the log link for the Gamma distribution.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  echo = TRUE,
  comment = "#>",
  cache = FALSE,
  fig.width=7, 
  fig.height=7
)
```

As always, we begin by loading the package.
```{r load, include=TRUE, message=FALSE}
library(causl)
library(survey)
library(dplyr)
library(caret)
```

## AMR Background
AMR is a novel estimator that claims to have lower variance than traditional
IPW/AIPW estimators. We test these claims in the causl package and show how
easy it is to test a novel method.

For the foundations of AMR, refer to \cite{...} 

```{r AMR estimator}
ate_amr <- function(dat, Kfolds = 5){

  folds <- createFolds(dat, k = Kfolds, list = TRUE, returnTrain = FALSE)

}
```


```{r}
forms <- list(
  
)
```
